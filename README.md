# JavaScript ⚡  
Personal project – Just for fun and learning

**JavaScript Playground** is a personal repository where I collect programming exercises and small projects developed in JavaScript. The main goal is to practice logic, reinforce core language concepts, and explore the possibilities JavaScript offers for web development.

This project is not linked to any course or academic work — it was created solely on my own initiative as a space for experimentation and continuous learning.
